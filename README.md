# Note:
> As I(we) am using firebase realted stuff.
> I am not including my firebase credentials of firebase service, for obvious reasons.
> **To build from source** 
> Create your own Firebase project at https://console.firebase.google.com/
> Get the SDK key file and rename it to firebase.json
> And place it in the source folder.
> i.e. src/firebase.json
> also you will have to replace the Firebase RTDB address throught the project!
